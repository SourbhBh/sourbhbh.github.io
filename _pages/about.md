I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Korteweg-De Vries Institute for Mathematics (KdVI), University of Amsterdam](https://kdvi.uva.nl/) working with [Joris Mooij](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.m.mooij/). I am also a member of the [Mercury Machine Learning Lab](https://icai.ai/lab/mercury-machine-learning-lab-amsterdam/), a collaboration between University of Amsterdam, Delft University of Technology and Booking.com. I graduated from the [School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.cornell.edu/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu), where I was jointly advised by [Aaron Wagner](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/wagner/) and [Jayadev Acharya](https://people.ece.cornell.edu/acharya/). In a past life, I was a BTech and MTech student in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in) from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in) and was fortunate to be advised by [Andrew Thangaraj](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~andrew).

Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in fundamental problems in causal inference, statistics and machine learning. Recent specific interests include statistical aspects of causal hypothesis testing with applications for reasoning about fairness and leveraging interventional data for causal discovery. During my PhD, I devoted a significant amount of time in understanding how stochastically-trained, artificial-neural-network-based (ANN-based) compressors perform well on multimedia sources.
